Problem Statement: What problem does this proposal seek to address?*

This project intends to bridge the DRep-delegate gap by providing a method of self-reporting for DReps and search-filter functions for delegates who may be looking for a representative that aligns with their values, principles and-or ethos. DReps will be self-reporting, providing the metadata that will create a governance-type map, allowing for broader exposure to, and communications with, delegates across the Cardano ecosystem.



Proposal Benefit: ¬†If implemented, what would be the benefit and to which parts of the community? Please include the demonstrated value or return on investment to the Cardano Community.*

This project will allow community members from across the ecosystem and world to coordinate, align, and come together to share their thoughts, and voices, for the betterment of the Cardano ecosystem. It will open doors to members as both DReps, delegates and any who wish to be informed by breaking apart silos, tearing down walls and allowing for broad discourse. 



Does this proposal align to the Product Roadmap and Roadmap Goals?*
Please¬†click here¬†to see details of the Product Roadmap.

It supports the product roadmap.



Please explain how your proposal supports the Product Roadmap.*

Our proposal is a governance tool that helps DReps and delegates coordinate, communicate and share knowledge. It allows the delegate to filter through all self-reporting DReps in order to narrow down their respective DRep field to find a matching or near-matching candidate providing them with a starting point to liquid democracy on Cardano.



Does your proposal align to any of the categories listed below?*

Governance Support



Committee Alignment: Which of the Intersect Committees does your proposal align to?*

Unsure -> because it could be aligned with more than one.



Supplementary Endorsement: If possible provide evidence of wider community endorsement for this proposal?
E.g., CIP/CPS discussion, Technical Working Group, Special Interest Group, draft committee budget code, or other forum where comments and consensus have been made to date.
Please share any links you have available.

Proposal Description: Please provide a high-level description / abstract of the proposal (2500 words max).*

With the creation, passing and ratification of the Cardano Constitution the community is now tasked with voting for proposals submitted by the others that drive the direction and improvements of the Cardano blockchain. To help make voting easier the governance delegated-representative (DRep) role has been created. This is role requires delegation from community members. Essentially delegates, in order to access their own staking rewards, must set their staked wallet to No Confidence, Abstain, Own Account (self-delegated) or delegate their wallet to a DRep. By delegating to a DRep the delegate has given the DRep voting power at a rate of 1 ADA = 1 vote. The ability to delegate whenever to whomever is considered a key characteristic of liquid democracy. Democracies can fail when constituents (i.e. ADA holders) are misinformed, or uninformed, and become, or are currently, closed off from broader delegation opportunities. This can have numerous impacts such as disenfranchisement, reduced participation and, at the extreme, centralization of power to the elites and privileged. Providing a bridge from delegate to DRep, from uninformed to informed, from unengaged to engaged, from voiceless to heard; these are all the areas this proposal intends to touch and solve by providing an opportunity to every ADA-holder to make an informed decision as to whom they wish to delegate to and for what causes. The processes of self-reporting intends to make transparent a DRep‚Äôs associations, actions, generalized drivers and other metrics allowing a drill-down filtering that aligns delgate to the DRep and vice-versa. DReps are in control of their data, minus any potential endorsements, and delegates are free to filter as desired. The end result is a delegate that is in control and can take necessary steps to be responsibly represented or may take on the role of DRep themselves.
