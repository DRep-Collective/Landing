# Intersect Proposal Submission Form

This form is open to any individual or organization within the Cardano ecosystem that wishes to submit a proposal related to the Cardano blockchain ecosystem for inclusion in a Cardano Budget facilitated by Intersect.

You do not need to be a member of Intersect to apply.

All proposals, except private contact details, will be made public to facilitate community and DRep review and decision-making.

If you have submitted or are already receiving funding for your proposal from Project Catalyst, you are not eligible to apply for funding through Intersect.

If you have made a prior proposal submission through an Intersect Committee, you will need to either;
  - Resubmit your proposal through this new process, this ensures all proposals will have the same information, look and feel for DRep reconciliation;
  - Or confirm if you would like Intersect to repurpose the information previously provided. Please note that we may not have enough details to complete the submission on your behalf, and any missing information will be shown as ‘not provided’. You can confirm this by contacting operational-services@intersectmbo.org with the following information:
    - Proposal Name
    - Proposer Name
    - Intersect Committee that it has been aligned / submitted to
    - Submission Date (approximate)
    - Intersect POC (if known)
    - Brief Proposal Description<br>

The more information you provide, the better we will be able to help you.<br>

#### Post Submission

Once you submit your proposal, our team will organise and group it in preparation for the Cardano Community and DReps to review. Intersect committees may provide advice or recommendations to help refine or improve your proposal, but all proposals will be made public (barring any private contact information). Committees can support DReps with advice, guidance, and recommendations to aid in their decision-making wherever helpful.

The budget process remains responsive to Community feedback. If you experience any issues, please do contact us at operational-services@intersectmbo.org.

We look forward to your submission and appreciate your contribution to the Cardano community!
