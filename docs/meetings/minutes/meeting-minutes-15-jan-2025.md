## Introduction and Disclaimer
`Disclaimer`: This transcript is an `AI-generated` document derived from a recorded meeting. As such, it may contain transcription inaccuracies or formatting inconsistencies. This document has not been officially vetted by any party but reflects a community-driven discussion.

## Important Notes on Context and Roles
- Discussions represent brainstorming and idea-sharing among community participants and do not necessarily reflect the official stances, policies, or commitments of any organization, including IO or CF.
- Ben O’Hanlon participated in this meeting in a personal capacity as a community member and member of Intersect**, not as an official representative of IO.
- This transcript and the associated discussions should not be construed as official proposals, commitments, or endorsements.

## Key Themes Discussed
- Metadata Standards: The need for metadata to be permanent, as well as data that can dynamically change based on voting and interactions.
- Ecosystem Mapping: Development of an interactive map for educational and navigational purposes within the Cardano ecosystem, with tie-ins to governance tools.
- Soulbound NFTs: Discussions on creating soulbound NFTs for voting passports, credentialing, and proof of reputation.
- Coordination and Structure: Challenges of coordinating DREPs and standardizing practices for improved interoperability.
- Community Involvement: Importance of self-reporting metadata to maintain transparency and autonomy in categorization.
- Funding and Adoption: Exploration of funding models for sustaining initiatives and strategies for driving ecosystem adoption.

## Excerpts on Specific Points
### Metadata Standards
Kevin Mohr: Into the metadata…we’ve sort of narrowed it down. We want permanent metadata and data that changes. Finalized votes at the end of a voting period need to be permanent. We don’t want those votes to change after the period has ended. Additionally, we’d have DREP IDs and wallet IDs so that NFTs can remain soulbound. Data that changes would be tied to user actions, like votes.

### Ecosystem Map
Kevin Mohr: The ecosystem map is going to be interactive, educational, and informative. It’ll correspond to certain actions with governance tools and other ecosystem parts. For example, if we go to Intersect and they pass some info action, a map could display Intersect’s role in the ecosystem. Maybe you’d get a stamp or credential for your voting passport.

### Soulbound NFTs
Ben O’Hanlon: One of the coolest things about the soulbound NFT concept is that it’s perennial. This isn’t just about creating NFTs; it’s about validating DREPs and reflecting voting histories. It’s also about creating sustainable, self-reporting content that generates revenue opportunities for stakeholders like DREPs and SPOs.

### Adoption Strategies
So Litty Records: For adoption, we should start aggregating a list of platforms to engage with, like wallets, Pool PM, and others. Offering assistance to these platforms in implementing standards can accelerate adoption.

## Next Steps and Workstreams
- Metadata Workstream: Finalizing standards for permanent and dynamic metadata. Ensuring interoperability with ecosystem tools.
- Ecosystem Mapping: Developing the interactive map and defining its functionality.
- Community Engagement: Establishing a Discord for discussions, hosting future calls, and creating centralized resources.
- Funding Models: Exploring Catalyst proposals, public goods funding, and potential DAO frameworks.

## Final Notes
- The next meeting will focus on formalizing responsibilities, identifying actionable steps, and securing funding for ongoing work.
- A link tree will be created to centralize resources, including relevant documents, standards, and discussion platforms.
- Feedback is welcome to refine this transcript and drive alignment across stakeholders.

## Thank you to all participants for contributing to this evolving discussion.
- This transcript represents a collaborative effort to advance decentralized governance and ecosystem growth on Cardano.
