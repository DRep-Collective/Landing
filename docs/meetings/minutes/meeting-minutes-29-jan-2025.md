Metadata Discussion
February 1 Deadline: The team emphasized the urgency of gathering community feedback before the February 1 deadline for metadata submissions. Members need to ensure that all perspectives are represented.
Community Involvement: There is a strong desire for the metadata project to reflect the collective’s needs, indicating that input should not just be top-down but involve grassroots feedback.
Feedback Mechanism: A proposal was made to create a Google Form to facilitate structured feedback collection. This would streamline the process and make it easier for community members to provide their thoughts without the chaos of open discussions.
Ecosystem Mapping
Work Streams Identified:
Need:
Working docs, channel strategy & content.
Working docs, workstreams written out.
Outreach: Engage with wallet providers and third parties to ensure their needs and capabilities are included in the metadata discussions.
Mapping: Focus on the artistic and functional aspects of the ecosystem maps, ensuring they are visually appealing and informative.
Development: Previous research should be bundled and made accessible to inform current mapping efforts, ensuring the collective builds upon past work rather than starting anew.
Importance of Collaboration: Stress on the need for various stakeholders, including developers, community members, and external partners, to work together to ensure the ecosystem map is comprehensive and functional.
Social Media and Community Engagement
