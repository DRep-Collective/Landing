## Summary

- The DREP Collective meeting primarily revolved around reviewing and debating metadata standards and user journey development for their platform. The discussion focused on the complexity and practicality of defining ecosystem roles—originating from IOG’s and Ben’s input—which are intended to categorize participants within the Cardano ecosystem. Members expressed concerns about the sheer number of roles (40-45) making user selection cumbersome, suggesting a need for consolidation and clearer role definitions. The debate highlighted the balance between providing detailed, useful information and avoiding overwhelming users with excessive choices. Specific nuances between roles like node operators versus stake pool operators were examined to clarify terminology. The team also discussed the potential development of reference documents or dropdown menus to simplify user experience while preserving ecosystem diversity. Lastly, the meeting touched on upcoming community engagement opportunities, including plans for a constitutional convention to address “constitutional debt” and the idea of synchronizing community efforts at various blockchain events, including Hawaii’s blockchain summit and other global gatherings.

### Key Insights

🔍 Role Overload Can Hinder Usability: Having 40-45 roles available creates a large dropdown menu, potentially frustrating users. Simplifying and consolidating roles into broader categories would make onboarding smoother and avoid decision fatigue, facilitating easier profile creation and ecosystem mapping.

🤖 Balancing Detail and Usability Is Crucial: While detailed roles allow for precise classification and ecosystem representation, too much detail risks alienating users or complicating filtering by delegates. Striking a middle ground with primary roles and optional detailed subroles could optimize user experience and developer implementation.

⚠️ Definitions and Validation Are Necessary: Some roles, such as “ADA holder,” are too generic, whereas others may overlap or lack clear boundaries. Defining and validating these roles is critical to ensure consistency, prevent misclassification, and uphold data quality, though it requires effort and governance alignment.

🔄 Differentiation Between Node and Stake Pool Operators Is Important: The community recognizes subtle but important differences within technical roles, such as node operators who maintain network nodes but don’t necessarily operate stake pools. A clear taxonomy mitigates confusion and better reflects real-world contributions.

🧭 Reference Documents Aid Adoption: Creating dedicated reference pages for complex roles helps users understand specialized functions without cluttering front-end menus. This layered approach supports ecosystem education while keeping the interface clean and accessible.

🌐 Community Engagement Through Events Strengthens Momentum: The hopes to organize constitutional conventions during major blockchain summits like Hawaii’s and others worldwide demonstrate the community’s intention to collaboratively address foundational governance and development challenges, accelerating progress.

🛠️ Open Call for Volunteers to Develop Metadata Mapping: The meeting emphasized the need for contributors to help build out apps and mapping tools, highlighting the collaborative nature of the project and the importance of community-driven development to meet evolving standards.

This meeting reflects a thoughtful, community-driven approach to managing metadata standards and ecosystem mapping, balancing complexity with usability while aiming to foster stronger collaboration through upcoming events and constitutional work.
