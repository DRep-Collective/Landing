# All Collective Documentation
Process:
  - all docs should be converted to PDF (if it makes sense) and stored as PDFs (or accepted file-type: md, json, etc.) in the folder `docs` if general, or to `docs/org` if Collective documentation
  - Link to the uploaded document should be put below. Follow these steps:
    - right-click Drep-Collective / `landing` (top-left) and SELECT `open in new tab`
    - in new tab, click on `org-docs` folder
    - right-click uploaded document and select `copy-link`
    - past link below in `(  )`
    - ctrl + s (to save) or click green `commit changes` button
    - click `commit changes` on pop-up
    - done
  - example: `[doc-name](https://github.com/drep-collective/org-docs/[your-file-name])`
