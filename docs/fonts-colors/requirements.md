### **DRep Collective – Brand Package Overview**  

We need a **professional, cohesive brand package** for the **DRep Collective** to ensure a unified identity across our website, logo, and any future materials. Below is what we’re looking for and how you can approach it at a high level.  

---

### **1. Core Brand Identity**  
- **Colors (Primary & Secondary Palette)** – The most critical part. Define a **primary color set** (main brand colors) and **secondary colors** (accents, highlights, backgrounds). Ideally, provide HEX/RGB values.  
- **Typography** – Recommend a font or font pairings that fit the brand’s personality.  
- **Logo Guidelines** – If applicable, any rules for logo usage (e.g., black/white versions, spacing, placement).

### **2. Visual Aesthetic**  
- **Mood & Tone** – General feel (e.g., professional, futuristic, minimal, bold). A short description or a mood board would be helpful.  
- **Imagery & Textures** (Optional) – Any recurring graphic elements, patterns, or icon styles that should be consistent.

### **3. Practical Execution**  
Since this will be applied to a website and other assets, it should be something that translates well into UI/UX. If possible:  
- Keep color contrast in mind for accessibility.  
- Ensure fonts work well on both web and print.  
- Consider a scalable approach so we can evolve the brand as needed.
