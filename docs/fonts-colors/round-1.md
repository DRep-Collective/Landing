# Color Palette and Fonts

## Round 1

### Consider:
- [Digital Accessibility: Color](https://dap.berkeley.edu/learn/accessibility-basics/color)
- More links at bottom

### **__Fonts:__**
- None selected
- Suggest nothing fancy. Fonts must be available across OSes (Linux, Win, MacOS, iOS, iPadOS, Android, GrapheneOS, others?)
- According to [this post](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/fonts#hosting-and-services) fonts were in two camps: Google and Adobe.
- Basic, unless self-hosted, fonts are best option (???); think Arial, etc.

### **__Palette:__**
1. [Suggested Primary & Secondary Colors:]( https://github.com/st8tikratio/Uselessness/blob/main/papers/screens/palette-1-collective.png) 
    - #FBCD4B - Buttercup
    - #A3A599 - Silver Plate
    - #282643 - Dark
    - #88A550 - Algae
    - use [this link](https://reallybigshoe.co.uk/visualiser/index.html) and plug in colors
    - the colors above are rather neutral
2. Github code in [#5 below](https://mixable.blog/adjust-text-color-to-be-readable-on-light-and-dark-backgrounds-of-user-interfaces/) to program in alt-palette colors depending on light/dark background
3. Logo color could be `#D33E43 (Poppy)` which is easily visible on both white/black visible but may cause visually-impaired issues. Otherwise we can use one of the primary or secondary colors.

### **__Visualizers:__**
- See `Links` below, [#2](https://reallybigshoe.co.uk/visualiser/index.html), [#3](https://coolors.co/577590-f3ca40-f2a541-f08a4b-d78a76)
