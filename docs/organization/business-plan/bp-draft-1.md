**Business Model & Unit Economics**

### **Business Model**

Our governance collective operates on a **hybrid revenue model** that leverages **treasury withdrawals, management fees, governance staking, and partnerships** to ensure sustainability and long-term growth.

* **Treasury Withdrawals (90% of Revenue):** We must be transparent with the community and ask for financing.  
* **Transaction & Processing Fees (1% of Revenue):** A small percentage is charged on governance transactions, including proposal submissions, NFT-based voting mechanisms, and treasury allocations.  
* **Governance Staking & Incentives (Possible Revenue):** Users stake governance tokens to participate in decision-making, earning rewards based on their engagement and contributions.  
* **Partnership & Integration Fees (2% of Revenue):** Collaborations with DeFi projects, DAOs, and blockchain networks generate revenue through integration and consulting services.  
* **NFT & Metadata-Based Revenue (7% of Revenue):** Special NFT collections and metadata services unlock advanced governance features and serve as access passes to premium decision-making layers.

### **Unit Economics**

* **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** Costs associated with onboarding new users, including marketing, educational campaigns, and referral programs.  
* **Lifetime Value (LTV):** The projected revenue from each participant through membership fees, transaction fees, and staking over their engagement period.  
* **Contribution Margin:** Revenue from governance activities minus operational costs such as blockchain development, server maintenance, and community support.  
* **Staking & Liquidity Mechanisms:** Ensuring that governance token incentives and staking mechanisms are optimized to sustain participation without excessive inflation.  
* **Efficiency Ratios:** Measuring governance engagement per user to ensure high participation levels relative to network costs.
