## About
The DRep Collective is a community intitiative created to provide greater visibility and availability of governance DReps across the Cardano block-chain ecosystem. The idea is to allow DReps to provide their personal areas of interest, experience and knowledge while also providing delegates the ability to locate and support DReps who may align with their own values, interests and priorities.

We continue to push for an informed international community and encourage all DReps to join the intitiative.
